## üß† How does it work?

- Each client maintains a CRDT-backed local document state.
- The server:
  - Manages client connections
  - Broadcasts operations to all clients
- Clients:
  - Connect and send operations to the server
  - Render the document in a TUI
  - Handle key events and dispatch changes
